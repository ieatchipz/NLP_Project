Nov 16 Lecture Notes: (how to solve part 2)

What will we be doing? -> chops up string into all pieces and create a sentence object with all three //that the method will return 

For Political Dataset: 
hw 5 problem 8 convert line method 


double comma: no data given

For covid Dataset: 

way 1: in excel, force it to put double quotes around everything (reformatting file to have double quotes)
Make sure to submit with every file you submit it so it is updated

way 2: algorithm, write a while loop that starts at the beg stop everytime theres a comma and empty basket
-> if after a comma there is a double quote, keep reading till theres another double quote
(flag that turns on if theres a double quote and munches everything till the next double quote)
